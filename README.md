## Description

This application allows the user to log the workouts and the exercises included that they complete. By utilizing a mongoDB database the user is able to log each new workout and add the various exercises to each workout.

The user is able to select from 'resistance' & 'cardio' exercise types and the corresponding data types adjust to their selection. The user is able to start a workout, leave the application to perform their exercises, then return to log that exercise to the same workout.  In other words, the user does not need to keep the application open during their workouts.

The user is able to view stats of their workouts and exercises on a dashboard that allows the user to analyze and track their results.
