## Description

This application allows the user to log all the different hamburgers that he/she would like to eat. When the user devours one of the burgers, the user can click the button to indicate that they have eaten that burger.  

Utilizing a MYSQL database the application will retain the data entered and will deliver it back to the user when he/she returns.

This application is also mobile responsive, which allows the user to utilize the application in real-time while they are devouring burgers (just like Popeye's friend, Wimpy)!
